# machinelearning
In this project we will train a STOP SIGN to be detected by a Web Cam using Python, OpenCV and HaarCascades. The training using Machine Learning and OpenCV provided tools/exe's on Windows will allow us to create an XML file called cascade.xml which is the main data file that the Python program live.py will consume to have the Machine learning trained data set.
